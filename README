= What is This? =

We've confused representations (files) with resources (urls). dirrest keeps the 2 distinct.

In dirrest, resources are represented by directories. This means that you are forced to make the distinction. Files within the directory are the representations/physical manifestations of the resource. They are named by their mime type (with "/" replaced with "." due to "/" being reserved as a path separator).

restdir encourages some other REST principles:

POST -> create new subordinate resources
PUT -> overwrite the resource (idempotent)

= Examples =

The following examples presume a directory tree like the following. "->" represents a symbolic link. "*" represents an executable file.

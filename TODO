* Defects
** TODO Switch to Network.listenOn
** TODO Implement CGI.
** TODO Implement SCGI over unix domain sockets.
** TODO Canonicalize URLs (some//thing gives a 404 while some/thing works, make sure to strip trailing / (with a redirect or something)).
** TODO Block reserved CGI environment variables from being overwritten.
*** Still necessary after CGI support?
* Documentation
** TODO Create a simple example site/application in an examples directory.
** TODO Write an article about how I use it for jekor.com.
** TODO Request and Response headers
** TODO Document what happens with ambiguity.
*** In practice, it's not generally a problem.
** TODO De-emphasize the whole multiple-representations thing. More important is that each resource can have sub-resources.
** TODO Create a more comprehensive example site.
** TODO Write a manpage.
* Security:
** TODO Use a sandbox/chroot if possible.
*** Make sure you can't traverse above the web root if not possible.
** TODO Make sure that headers are safely converted to environment variables (not overwriting sensitive/critical environment variables).
** TODO Build in limits against DoS attacks.
** TODO Document SSL
*** Why it's not implemented natively.
*** How to deal with https:// URLs.
* Features
** TODO Make sure that fsrest handles ambiguity deterministically (maybe the most recent representation or the oldest or something).
** TODO Default to responding to posts with type text/plain? Make it possible to indicate the response content type?
** TODO Add support for negotiating languages.
** TODO Explore the HTTP last modified header.
** TODO Create a ready-made user/security system.
** TODO Allow PUT to traverse up above parents to higher ancestor resources.
** TODO Handle Range request

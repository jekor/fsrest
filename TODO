* Defects
** Canonicalize URLs (some//thing gives a 404 while some/thing works, make sure to strip trailing / (with a redirect or something)).
** Block reserved CGI environment variables from being overwritten.
* Documentation
** What happens with ambiguity?
*** In practice, it's not generally a problem.
** De-emphasize the whole multiple-representations thing. More important is that each resource can have sub-resources.
* Features
** Make sure that fsrest handles ambiguity deterministically (maybe the most recent representation or the oldest or something).
** Default to responding to posts with type text/plain? Make it possible to indicate the response content type?
** Write a manpage.
** Add support for negotiating languages.
** Check the exit code of a program. If non-zero, give an error to the client.
** Map exit codes to HTTP error codes?
** Make it a standalone server.
